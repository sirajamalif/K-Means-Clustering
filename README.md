#  K-Means Clustering – Mini Project

This project shows how I applied **K-Means Clustering** on a dataset with features like pricing, cost, profit, and units sold. It includes:

* Preprocessing data (removing dollar signs, scaling, etc.)
* Choosing the best `k` using the **Elbow Method**
* Training a K-Means model and checking **Silhouette Score**
* Saving and reusing the model with **pickle**
* Testing the model on new/unseen data

###  Notebooks

* `KMC.ipynb` → Main clustering workflow (preprocessing, training, visualization)
* `KMC test.ipynb` → Loads the saved model and tests it on new data

###  Tools Used

`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `sklearn`, `pickle`
